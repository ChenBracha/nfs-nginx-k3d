# ðŸš€ NFS with K3d and NGINX
# ðŸ“¦ NFS + K3D + NGINX Deployment (macOS)

This project demonstrates a simple Kubernetes setup on macOS using `k3d`, where:
- A local folder (`storage/index.html`) is mounted as NFS-like shared storage.
- NGINX serves content from this shared volume.
- The deployment is fully automated with scripts.
